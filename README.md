# epochconv

## !!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!

This project has been permanently moved to Codeberg
([epochconv](https://codeberg.org/dinofp/epochconv)) and is no longer actively
maintained on Github. Do not use the Issues system on Github to report to us.
Don't bother forking or getting source from here as it will not be updated.

Microsoft is not a friend of open-source and we do ourselves a disservice
giving them this impressive power over our work.

Never forget 2020 when Github (a Microsoft product) removed the popular
open-source `youtube-dl` project, sparking enormous controversy. The issue is
not that pushback eventually prompted reinstatement - Github can and will act
like this against us at any time.

## Synopsis

Convert between epoch and various date formats (Haskell)


## Description

Show a given date (or the current date) in a variety of formats. This
was partly an exercise in grokking the Haskell date/time APIs.

The source code for this project is in a single file that's set up as a Haskell
script. Just run it!

If you wish, it can also be compiled into a binary. The necessary files for
doing so are include in this repo.


## Development

Building as usual:

    $ stack build
    $ stack exec epochconv
