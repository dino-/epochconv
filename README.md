# epochconv


## Synopsis

Convert between epoch and various date formats (Haskell)


## Description

Show a given date (or the current date) in a variety of formats. This
was partly an exercise in grokking the Haskell date/time APIs.

The source code for this project is in a single file that's set up as a Haskell
script. Just run it!

If you wish, it can also be compiled into a binary. The necessary files for
doing so are include in this repo.


## Development

Building as usual:

    $ stack build
    $ stack exec epochconv
